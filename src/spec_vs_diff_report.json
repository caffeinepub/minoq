  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` and shows no evidence of any frontend code changes to Admin price inputs or WhatsApp price extraction logic. Therefore REQ-21 is not implemented in the provided diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Fix the Admin Mode product price inputs so admins can type alphabetic characters (alphanumeric) in the price box without the UI preventing keystrokes, while preserving existing behavior: (1) store/show the typed alphanumeric text as the product’s display price, and (2) continue extracting and using a numeric-only price value for the WhatsApp “Buy Now” message/link generation; also validate that extracted numeric value > 0 and show existing English error if not.",
      "reason": "No relevant frontend implementation changes are shown; only `project_state.json` was modified, which does not demonstrate updates to input handling, display storage, WhatsApp link generation, or validation behavior.",
